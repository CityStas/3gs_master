# Class: SpringConstraint

> Simulates spring and damper behavior between two attachments.

## Description

A **SpringConstraint** applies a force to its [Attachments](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment.md)
based on spring and damper behavior. This constraint, along with a
[CylindricalConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/CylindricalConstraint.md), is ideal for building vehicle suspension.

Note that if this constraint attaches one part (**A**) to another part (**B**)
that is anchored or connected to an anchored part (**Z**), part **A** will not
be locally simulated when interacting with a player.

When configuring this constraint, it may be helpful to study
[Roblox Units](/docs/en-us/physics/units.md) to understand how Roblox units
compare to metric units.

#### Free Length

[FreeLength](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) defines the natural resting
length of the spring. If the attachments are further apart than the free
length, they are forced together; if the attachments are closer together than
the free length, they are forced apart.

#### Damping

The [Damping](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) value controls how fast the
spring's oscillation dies down. A value of 0 allows the spring to oscillate
endlessly, while higher values bring the spring to a rest more quickly.

#### Stiffness

[Stiffness](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) sets the strength of the spring.
Higher values create a spring that responds with more force when its
attachments are closer together or further apart than
[FreeLength](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md).

#### Limits

Enabling the [LimitsEnabled](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) property
exposes the [MinLength](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) and
[MaxLength](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) values for setting the minimum
and maximum length of the spring. If the spring's attachments reach these
limits, they stop moving apart from one another without restitution.

## Properties

### Property: SpringConstraint.Coils

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": true,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Appearance",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

The number of coils visualized on the [SpringConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md). This can
only be set between 0 and 8.

### Property: SpringConstraint.CurrentLength

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": false,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Derived",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

The current distance between the constraint's
[Attachments](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment.md).

### Property: SpringConstraint.Damping

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": true,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Spring",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

Damping constant for the [SpringConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md). Multiplied to the
velocity of the constraint's [Attachments](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment.md) to reduce the
spring force applied.

### Property: SpringConstraint.FreeLength

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": true,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Spring",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

Natural resting length of the spring.

### Property: SpringConstraint.LimitsEnabled

```json
{
  "type": "boolean",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": true,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Spring",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

Sets whether the [SpringConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) enforces a minimum and maximum
length. If the constraint's [Attachments](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment.md) reach these
limits, they will simply stop moving apart from one another without
restitution. If you need restitution or elasticity at the ends of the
range of motion, you can combine a [SpringConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) with another
constraint that allows restitution at the end of its range, such as a
[PrismaticConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/PrismaticConstraint.md) or [RopeConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/RopeConstraint.md).

### Property: SpringConstraint.MaxForce

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": true,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Spring",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

The maximum force the [SpringConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) can apply on its
[Attachments](/docs/reference/engine/classes/Attachment.md). Some spring systems can give rise to
forces that grow fast leading to instability. In such cases it is
recommended to set MaxForce to a reasonable value.

### Property: SpringConstraint.MaxLength

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": true,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Limits",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

The maximum separation the [SpringConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) will allow if
[LimitsEnabled](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) is true.

### Property: SpringConstraint.MinLength

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": true,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Limits",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

The minimum separation the [SpringConstraint](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) will allow if
[LimitsEnabled](/docs/reference/engine/classes/SpringConstraint.md) is true.

### Property: SpringConstraint.Radius

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
    "write": "None"
  },
  "serialization": {
    "can_load": true,
    "can_save": true
  },
  "thread_safety": "ReadSafe",
  "category": "Appearance",
  "capabilities": [
    "Physics"
  ],
  "simulationAccess": true
}
```

The visualized radius of the spring's coils.

### Property: SpringConstraint.Stiffness

```json
{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",

{
  "type": "float",
  "access": "ReadWrite",
  "security": {
    "read": "None",
