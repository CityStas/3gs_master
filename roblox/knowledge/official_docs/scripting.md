# Scripting

Scripts are plain text files that let you add custom, dynamic behavior to your games. You can use scripts to trigger in-game events, respond to player input, save player data, create leaderboards, spawn enemies, control NPC behavior, and much, much more.

> **Success:** This section is for creators with some coding experience who want to know the specifics of scripting in Roblox.
>
> If you've never written code before and want an introduction to programming, see [Coding fundamentals](/docs/en-us/tutorials/fundamentals/coding-1/coding-fundamentals.md), which covers concepts like variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and arrays. For a more guided, step-by-step approach, see the [Basic gameplay](/docs/en-us/tutorials/use-case-tutorials/scripting/basic-scripting/intro-to-scripting.md) tutorial.
## Luau

Roblox scripts use the [Luau](https://luau.org) programming language, which is derived from [Lua 5.1](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/).

- Compared to Lua 5.1, Luau adds performance enhancements and many useful features, including an optional typing system, string interpolation, and generalized iteration for tables.
- All valid Lua 5.1 code is valid Luau code, but the opposite is not true.

Most books and online resources for Lua are still broadly applicable to Luau. For a detailed summary of differences, see [Compatibility](https://luau.org/compatibility) in the Luau documentation. For language syntax, see the [Luau reference](/docs/en-us/luau.md).

### Luau basics

Luau is gradually typed, so you don't need to specify a type when you create a variable. You can use `Global.LuaGlobals.type()` to check object type:

```lua
logMessage = "User has more than 10 items!"
print(logMessage) --> User has more than 10 items!
print(type(logMessage)) --> string
```

Luau has global and local [scopes](/docs/en-us/luau/scope.md), but it's almost always better to declare variables and functions locally with the `local` keyword:

```lua
local logMessage = "User has more than 10 items!"
local function printMessage()
	print(logMessage)
end
printMessage() --> User has more than 10 items!
```

Luau uses `nil` to represent nonexistence or nothingness, which evaluates as `false` in conditional statements:

```lua
local messageToUser
print(messageToUser) --> nil
print(type(messageToUser)) --> nil
if messageToUser then
	-- statement evaluates to false
end
```

As you might have noticed, `--` starts a one-line comment. `--[[]]` creates a block comment:

```lua
--[[
    Shuts off the cosmic moon ray immediately.

    Should only be called within 15 minutes of midnight Mountain Standard
    Time to avoid damage to the cosmic moon ray.
]]
local function stopCosmicMoonRay()
	-- add this later, it might prove important
end
```

[Tables](/docs/en-us/luau/tables.md) are the generic term for arrays and dictionaries. Arrays are one-based rather than zero-based, so the first item is `[1]`. You declare arrays and dictionaries with a single set of curly braces:

```lua
local myArray = {"chips", "sparkling water", "salsa"}
local myDictionary = {
	snack = "chips",
	drink = "sparkling water",
	dip = "salsa"
}
print(myArray[1]) --> chips
print(myDictionary.dip) --> salsa
```

You can iterate over tables using `for` loops with the `Global.LuaGlobals.ipairs()` function for arrays and the `Global.LuaGlobals.pairs()` function for dictionaries, but Luau also lets you omit these functions for cleaner syntax:

```lua
for index, value in ipairs(myArray) do -- standard Lua
	print(index, value)
end
for key, value in pairs(myDictionary) do -- standard Lua
	print(key, value)
end
for key, value in myDictionary do -- Luau generalized iteration
	print(key, value)
end
```

## Your first script

1. In Roblox Studio, hover over **ServerScriptService** in the [Explorer](/docs/en-us/studio/explorer.md) window and click **+**.
2. Select **Script** to add a new script.
3. Right-click the script and rename it to `HelloScript`.
4. Double-click the script to open it in the [Script Editor](/docs/en-us/studio/script-editor.md).
5. Add the following code to the file:```lua
local helloArray = {"h", "e", "l", "l", "o"}
local worldArray = {"w", "o", "r", "l", "d"}

for index, value in helloArray do
	print(value)
end

print(table.concat(worldArray))
```
6. Ensure that the [Output](/docs/en-us/studio/output.md) window is open.
7. [Run your game](/docs/en-us/studio/testing-modes.md#playtesting) and note the output:```text
h
e
l (x2)
o
world
```

## Get comfortable

A big part of adapting to a new development environment is configuring it to meet your needs and understanding the tools at your disposal:

- The **Script Editor** section of [Studio Settings](/docs/en-us/studio/setup.md#customization) lets you adjust quality of life features like font, colors, indentation, autocomplete, brackets, and tooltips. You might also want to enable dark mode in the **Studio** section.
- Holding `Ctrl` or `Command` and clicking on a function or variable takes you to its declaration in your codebase (or its online documentation). Using [Find and Find All](/docs/en-us/studio/script-editor.md#find-and-replace) can help you navigate larger projects.
- The [Output](/docs/en-us/studio/output.md) window is the most basic tool for understanding the behavior of your scripts. Use the **⋯** menu to enable **Show Context** and **Show Source**.
- The [Script Analysis](/docs/en-us/studio/script-editor.md#script-analysis) window shows a summary of errors and warnings, but you might find its utility limited; the Script Editor already highlights these issues as you type.
- Logging capabilities are minimal, with no concept of log levels like `DEBUG` or `FATAL`. Use `Global.LuaGlobals.print()` and `Global.RobloxGlobals.warn()`.

For more information about configuring Studio for scripting, see [Script Editor](/docs/en-us/studio/script-editor.md).

> **Success:** Many developers prefer to use an external text editor and version control system rather than the built-in editor. See [Script Sync](/docs/en-us/sync.md) and [third-party tools](/docs/en-us/projects/external-tools.md).
## Your second script

1. In Roblox Studio, add a script to **ReplicatedStorage** in the [Explorer](/docs/en-us/studio/explorer.md) window and rename it to `OhNo`.
2. Add the following code to the file:```lua
print("Hello script types and locations!")
```
3. [Run your game](/docs/en-us/studio/testing-modes.md#playtesting).
4. Note how the output is no different than when you ran [your first script](#your-first-script).

To understand why the script didn't run, see [Script Types and Locations](/docs/en-us/locations.md).
